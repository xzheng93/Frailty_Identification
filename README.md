This repository contains the python code for using ML to identify Frailty in long term care facilities based on gait and physical activity derived from one accelerometer as presented in[Identifying Frail Older Adults in Long-Term Care Facilities Using Machine Learning on Gait and Daily Physical Activity Data from a Single Accelerometer].


### code and other documents will be released soon.
