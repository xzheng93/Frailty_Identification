# Identifying Frail Older Adults in Long-Term Care Facilities Using Machine Learning on Gait and Daily Physical Activity Data from a Single Accelerometer

![ ](https://github.com/xzheng93/Frailty_Identification/blob/main/data_pipeline.pdf)  

This repository contains the python code for using ML to identify Frailty in long term care facilities based on gait and physical activity derived from one accelerometer as presented in[Identifying Frail Older Adults in Long-Term Care Facilities Using Machine Learning on Gait and Daily Physical Activity Data from a Single Accelerometer]().


### code and other documents will be released soon.
